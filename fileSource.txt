By the time the London Wall was constructed,
the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced
problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long
period of instability and decline, including the
Carausian Revolt in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries,
the city was under attack from Picts, Scots, and Saxon raiders.
The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire.
